# TidyLFG

TidyLFG is an addon designed to enhance your Mythic+ experience by filtering out unwanted advertisements and allowing players to filter regional realms in the LFG tool.

## Addon Features

TidyLFG specifically applies to M+ dungeon listings found under the Premade Group > Dungeons menu in the Group Finder.

* **Advertisement Filtering**:
    * Advertisers often follow predictable patterns that differ from those of genuine players. TidyLFG uses these patterns to filter out spam from your listings. However, due to limitations imposed by Blizzard's protected API areas, this filter, while effective, may not catch everything.

* **Realm Filtering**:
    * You can choose to filter out specific regional realms. This feature helps avoid high latency and ping, which can occur when, for example, a North American player joins a group led by someone on an Oceanic realm. This realm phasing can lead to poor network performance and a subpar gaming experience for both you and your party.
    
## Options

To open the TidyLFG options, type /tl or /tidy in the chat, or access it through the in-game Options menu.

In the Options menu, you can customize your realm filters and enable logs to be shown in your chat window. There's also a log button at the top of your Group Finder window for quick access.
